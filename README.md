# Personalised Computer Project

## Introduction
This repository houses the ongoing research and development efforts surrounding the "Personalised Computer," a specialized Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation. This project explores the hypothesis that the Personalised Computer played a significant role in the development of Super Mario 64, leveraging a unique AI for personalization effects. It runs on a modified branch of the IRIX operating system, featuring a customized GUI and an extensively altered kernel. Our work also delves into the Nintendo Ultra Simulator (UltraSim), a proprietary emulator developed by Silicon Graphics in mid-1995 for the Nintendo 64.

## Installation
To get started with the Personalised Computer project, clone this repository to your local machine. Given the specialized nature of the software and its reliance on proprietary hardware, specific setup instructions will vary. Detailed setup guides are available in the [docs](/docs) directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlamesCo/personlizedpc.md.git
cd personlizedpc.md
Usage
Within this repository, you'll find tools and documentation aimed at replicating the Personalised Computer's environment and functionalities. Usage instructions for each tool, including how to simulate the effects seen in Super Mario 64 and operate the UltraSim emulator, are provided in their respective directories.

Contributing
We welcome contributions from researchers, enthusiasts, and anyone interested in the preservation and exploration of video game development history. Whether it's adding documentation, improving the emulator's accuracy, or sharing findings related to the Personalised Computer, your input is invaluable. Please see CONTRIBUTING.md for more details on how to get involved.
